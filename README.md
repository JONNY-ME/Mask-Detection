# Mask-Detection

simple machine-learning model which detect whether there is a mask or not.
I used over 100,000 images to train the model and test it using local data it has quite amazing accuracy.

To use this model 
- clone the file to local 
- install the requirements by pip install -r requirements.txt
- download the model weights and add them to directory named models you can download the models by using this link https://t.me/model_weights
- then just run  main.py file which is found in src folder.
